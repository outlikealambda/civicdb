Civic-Celerator Project (backend)
=================================

1. Attempts to disambiguate people (and other entities like office and committee) across all data inputs.
2. Builds a graph database modeling relationships between entities.
3. Attempts to navigate the graph database in a meaningful way to simply and visually answer questions like: Who gave to two different candidates in the same race? (Not part of this repo)

Requires
--------
Neo4j to populate the graph database
